					<h1>Target Audience</h1>
					<p>
						We cater to clients who want our bikes. Most are passionate about biking and see it as part of a lifestyle.
						This might mean they are competitive, like to style their vehicles, incorporate biking into their daily lives for
						transportation or may just be a weekend warrior. Many members visit the site to place orders and to see the new stock.
						Our customers know bikes so they don't need large detailed descriptions about each product but they might be interested
						in the specs. They just need to see the name, price and image of the product.
						We are a business-to-customer organization (B2C). Requirements We want a site where customers can explore new bikes and
						add-ons that inspire and excite them. We want the world to see how fantastic these machines are.
						The bikes are the main attraction of this Website and everything should be designed around that.
						The Website should convey: style, quality, power/speed, and freedom.
